# The Google Homepage Reconstructed

## About
This is a mini-project as part of The Odin Project curriculum to create a basic website which is a clone of the Google.com homepage.

The goal is to practice basic HTML and CSS skills and become comfortable with the developer tools in Chrome.

The most challenging part will be to create an identical layout so the elements are placed on the page in the same way.

**HTML**
1. Logically dividing different parts of the page.
2. Sticking with accessibility.

**CSS** 
1. A responsive implementation utilizing flexbox and media queries.
2. Styling an input field with an icon.
3. Properly styling links.
4. Styling a navbar and fixed footer.
